## Lavarel React
- Sure! When you create a new React component using the command php artisan make:react Example, Laravel creates a new file named Example.jsx in the resources/js/components directory. This file contains the code for your new React component.

- use this component in your blade file, you need to add the @react directive to your blade file and pass the name of your component as an argument. For example, if you named your component Example, you would add the following code to your blade file:

@react('Example')
Copy
This tells Laravel to render the Example component in your blade file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
